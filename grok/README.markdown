# Yearbook Staff Role Assessment

This is a web-based adaptive assessment to help high school students determine their best fit for yearbook staff roles (Leadership, Photography, Design, Sidebar, Journalist, Page Finisher).

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one.
2. Place `index.html` and `questions.csv` in the root of your repository or a `docs` folder.
3. Go to your repository's Settings on GitHub.
4. Scroll to the "Pages" section.
5. Set the source to the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` if you created a separate branch) or the `docs` folder if used.
6. Save and wait for the deployment to complete.
7. Access the site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

## Notes
- Ensure both `index.html` and `questions.csv` are in the same directory.
- The site uses no external dependencies, so it should work immediately after deployment.
- If the site doesn't load, verify that GitHub Pages is enabled and the files are correctly placed.
